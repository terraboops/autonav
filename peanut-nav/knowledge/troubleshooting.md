# Troubleshooting Common Peanut Problems

## Poor Germination

**Symptoms**: Seeds fail to emerge, or emergence is spotty

**Causes**:
1. Soil too cold (below 65°F)
2. Soil too wet causing seed rot
3. Poor seed quality
4. Planting too deep
5. Soil crusting preventing emergence

**Solutions**:
- Wait for soil to warm to 65°F at 4-inch depth
- Improve drainage before planting
- Use certified seed
- Plant at proper depth (1-2 inches)
- Break crust with light cultivation or irrigation

## Yellow Leaves

**Symptoms**: Leaves turn yellow, plant appears stunted

**Causes**:
1. **Nitrogen deficiency** (rare in peanuts due to N-fixation)
   - Check for poor nodulation on roots
   - May occur in very sandy or poor soils

2. **Iron deficiency** (chlorosis)
   - Yellow between veins, veins stay green
   - Occurs in high pH soils (above 7.0)

3. **Disease** (leaf spots, wilt)
   - Check for spots, lesions, or wilting

4. **Water stress**
   - Either too much or too little water

**Solutions**:
- If N deficiency: Apply 20-30 lbs N/acre
- If iron deficiency: Lower soil pH with sulfur, apply foliar iron
- If disease: Implement fungicide program
- Adjust irrigation to maintain consistent moisture

## Poor Pod Set

**Symptoms**: Plants look healthy but produce few pods

**Causes**:
1. Water stress during pegging (60-110 days after planting)
2. Calcium deficiency
3. Compacted soil preventing peg penetration
4. Excessive nitrogen causing vegetative growth
5. Thrips damage to flowers

**Solutions**:
- Maintain consistent moisture during pegging
- Apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) at early bloom: 400-800 lbs/acre
- Cultivate soil to keep loose and friable
- Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization
- Control thrips with appropriate insecticide

## Hollow or "Pops"

**Symptoms**: Pods have incomplete kernel development, shells are hollow

**Causes**:
1. Water stress during pod fill (80-110 days after planting)
2. Calcium deficiency
3. Harvested too early
4. High temperatures during pod fill

**Solutions**:
- Ensure adequate water during critical period
- Apply gypsum at early bloom
- Wait until pods are fully mature before digging
- Some varieties are more prone to pops - consider variety change

## Pod Rot

**Symptoms**: Pods are discolored, soft, or rotted at harvest

**Causes**:
1. Excessive moisture late in season
2. Leaving pods in ground too long after maturity
3. Wet weather during harvest
4. Poor drainage
5. White mold or other soilborne diseases

**Solutions**:
- Reduce or stop irrigation 2-3 weeks before harvest
- Harvest promptly when mature
- Improve field drainage
- Rotate crops (4-year rotation minimum)
- Use disease-resistant varieties

## Aflatoxin Contamination

**Symptoms**: Not visible, but dangerous fungal toxin in kernels

**Risk Factors**:
1. Drought stress (especially late season)
2. Insect damage to pods
3. Harvesting too late
4. Poor curing and storage conditions
5. Hot, dry weather during pod maturity

**Prevention**:
- Maintain adequate moisture during pod fill
- Control pod-feeding insects (lesser cornstalk borer, wireworms)
- Harvest at proper maturity
- Cure and dry properly (target 7-10% moisture)
- Store in cool, dry conditions
- Consider planting resistant varieties

**Testing**: If you suspect aflatoxin, have samples tested before consumption. Aflatoxin-contaminated peanuts should not be eaten.

## Plants Fall Over (Lodging)

**Symptoms**: Plants lean or fall over before harvest

**Causes**:
1. Excessive nitrogen
2. Too much water
3. Dense planting
4. Weak stems from disease
5. Late-season storms

**Solutions**:
- Reduce nitrogen inputs
- Manage irrigation carefully
- Use proper plant spacing
- Control leaf spot diseases to maintain stem strength
- Consider variety with stronger stems

## Poor Yield Despite Good Pod Set

**Symptoms**: Many pods but low weight at harvest

**Causes**:
1. Harvested too early (immature kernels)
2. Variety not suited to growing season
3. Drought during kernel fill
4. Disease damage late in season

**Solutions**:
- Check pod maturity carefully before digging (70-80% dark veining)
- Select variety with appropriate days to maturity for your zone
- Maintain moisture through pod fill stage
- Continue leaf spot control until 2 weeks before harvest

## Tips for Success

1. **Soil pH is critical**: Test and adjust to 5.9-6.3
2. **Calcium is essential**: Apply gypsum at early bloom every year
3. **Water during pegging**: Most critical period for yield
4. **Scout regularly**: Catch pest and disease problems early
5. **Rotate crops**: Don't plant peanuts in same field more than 1 in 4 years
6. **Choose the right variety**: Match days to maturity with your growing season
7. **Cure properly**: Poor curing ruins quality no matter how well you grew them
