# Harvesting and Curing Peanuts

## Signs of Maturity

Peanuts are ready to harvest when:

1. **Pod maturity**: Check pods from middle of row
   - Scrape pods to reveal shell color
   - 70-80% of pods should show dark veining on inner shell
   - Kernels fill the pod completely

2. **Plant maturity**:
   - Lower leaves begin to yellow
   - Days to maturity for variety has passed (typically 120-160 days)

3. **Calendar timing**:
   - Zone 7: Late September to early October
   - Zone 8: Mid-September to late September
   - Zone 9: Early September to mid-September

**Critical**: Do not harvest too early or kernels will be immature and yield will suffer. Do not delay too long or pods will sprout in soil.

## Digging

### Equipment
- Small scale: Potato fork or garden fork
- Larger scale: Peanut digger/inverter

### Process
1. **Timing**: Dig when soil is slightly moist but not wet
2. **Method**:
   - Loosen soil 4-6 inches deep around plant
   - Lift entire plant with tap root intact
   - Shake gently to remove excess soil
   - Invert plants with pods exposed to air

3. **Weather**: Choose a period of 3-5 days of dry weather for field curing

## Curing (Critical Step)

Proper curing is essential for quality and storage:

### Field Curing (Weather Permitting)
- Leave plants inverted in rows for 3-5 days
- Turn windrows once if weather threatens
- Pods should dry to 10-15% moisture before removing from vines
- Night dew is okay, but avoid rain

### Barn/Shed Curing (Rainy Weather)
- Hang plants or spread on screens in well-ventilated area
- Ensure good air circulation
- Cure for 2-3 weeks until pods rattle when shaken
- Target moisture: 8-10% for storage

## Removing Pods from Vines

Hand picking (small scale):
- Pull or twist pods from vines
- Discard damaged or diseased pods
- Clean pods of dirt and debris

Mechanical (larger scale):
- Use a peanut picker/thresher
- Adjust settings to avoid pod damage

## Drying and Storage

### Final Drying
- Spread pods in thin layer (6 inches or less)
- Dry in ventilated area for additional 1-2 weeks
- Final moisture content should be 7-10%

### Storage Conditions
- **Temperature**: Cool (50-60°F ideal)
- **Humidity**: Low (50-70% relative humidity)
- **Container**: Mesh bags or bins with ventilation
- **Duration**: Up to 1 year if properly dried and stored

### Quality Check
- Properly cured peanuts should:
  - Rattle when shaken
  - Have crisp, not leathery, shells
  - Kernels should be firm and snap when broken
  - No musty or moldy smell

## Yield Expectations

Typical yields (in-shell):
- **Good management, Virginia types**: 3,000-4,000 lbs/acre
- **Good management, runner types**: 3,500-4,500 lbs/acre
- **Home garden**: 50-100 lbs per 100 sq ft

Shelling percentage: 70-75% (meaning 100 lbs in-shell yields 70-75 lbs kernels)

## Post-Harvest Processing

### Roasting
1. Preheat oven to 350°F
2. Spread raw peanuts in single layer on baking sheet
3. Roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes
4. Remove when shells are lightly browned
5. Let cool completely before storing

### Boiling (Green Peanuts)
1. Use freshly dug, uncured peanuts
2. Wash thoroughly
3. Boil in heavily salted water (1/2 cup salt per gallon)
4. Cook for 1-3 hours until soft
5. Eat immediately or freeze for later

**Note**: Green (boiled) peanuts must be consumed or frozen within 24-48 hours. They will spoil quickly.
