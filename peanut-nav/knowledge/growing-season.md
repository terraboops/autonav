# Growing Season Care

## Watering

Peanuts need 1-2 inches of water per week during:
- First 40 days after planting (establishment)
- 60-110 days after planting (pegging and pod fill)

**Critical period**: During pegging (when flowers form underground stems), maintain consistent moisture. Water stress during this period drastically reduces yield.

**Avoid overwatering**: Excessive water promotes disease and reduces pod quality. Stop watering 2-3 weeks before harvest.

## Fertility

Peanuts fix their own nitrogen and require minimal fertilization:

- **At planting**: Apply phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) based on soil test
  - Typical: 0-46-0 fertilizer at 300-500 lbs/acre
  - Peanuts respond well to calcium - apply gypsum at 400-800 lbs/acre at early bloom

- **Nitrogen**: Usually not needed due to nitrogen fixation
  - Exception: Apply 20-30 lbs N/acre only if planting in very poor soil

## Pest Control

### Common Pests

**Aphids** (Early season)
- Threshold: 10-20 per plant
- Control: Insecticidal soap, neem oil, or systemic insecticide

**Thrips** (Throughout season)
- Threshold: 5 per plant
- Control: Spinosad or pyrethroid insecticides

**Corn earworm** (Mid to late season)
- Monitor for eggs on foliage
- Control: Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) or pyrethroid

**Southern corn rootworm** (Pegging stage)
- Monitor adult beetles on foliage
- Control: Carbaryl or bifenthrin if threshold exceeded

### Integrated Pest Management
1. Scout weekly during growing season
2. Maintain field records of pest populations
3. Use economic thresholds to determine when to spray
4. Rotate insecticide modes of action to prevent resistance
5. Preserve beneficial insects - avoid broad-spectrum pesticides when possible

## Disease Prevention

### Early Leaf Spot (Cercospora arachidicola)
- First appears 40-50 days after planting
- Small brown spots on lower leaves
- Control: Fungicide spray every 14 days starting at 30-40 days after planting

### Late Leaf Spot (Cercosporidium personatum)
- Appears later than early leaf spot
- Larger, darker spots
- Control: Same fungicide program as early leaf spot

### White Mold (Sclerotium rolfsii)
- Favored by warm, wet conditions
- Wilted plants, white fungal growth at soil line
- Prevention: Crop rotation, avoid excessive irrigation, apply fungicide at early bloom

### Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV)
- Spread by thrips
- Stunted plants, ring spots on leaves
- Prevention: Control thrips early, plant resistant varieties, use reflective mulch

## Fungicide Program

Standard fungicide program for leaf spot:
1. First spray: 40-50 days after planting
2. Subsequent sprays: Every 10-14 days
3. Continue until 2 weeks before harvest
4. Rotate fungicide chemistry to prevent resistance

**Tip**: Disease pressure varies by region and weather. In dry years, you may reduce spray frequency. In wet years, increase frequency to 10-day intervals.
