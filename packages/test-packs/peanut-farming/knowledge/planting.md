# Planting Peanuts

## Soil Requirements

Peanuts require well-drained, sandy loam soil with a pH between 5.9 and 6.3. The soil should be loose and friable to allow proper peg penetration and pod development.

### Soil Preparation

1. Test soil pH 3-4 months before planting
2. If pH is below 5.9, apply lime at 1-2 tons per acre
3. Work the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches
4. Ensure good drainage - peanuts will not tolerate waterlogged conditions

## Planting Timing

Timing varies by USDA zone:

- **Zone 7**: Late April to mid-May (after last frost, when soil reaches 65°F)
- **Zone 8**: Mid-April to early May
- **Zone 9**: Early April to late April
- **Zone 10**: March to early April

**Critical**: Soil temperature must be at least 65°F at 4-inch depth for 3 consecutive days. Plant too early and seeds will rot.

## Spacing and Depth

- **Row spacing**: 36 inches between rows
- **Plant spacing**: 6-8 inches between plants in the row
- **Planting depth**: 1-2 inches deep
- **Seed rate**: 100-120 pounds per acre (Virginia type) or 50-75 pounds per acre (runner type)

## Varieties

### Virginia Types (Larger pods)
- Gregory - Disease resistant, high yield
- Sullivan - Good for boiling
- NC-V 11 - High oleic acid

### Runner Types (Smaller, uniform pods)
- Georgia-06G - High oleic, disease resistant
- TUFRunner 727 - Excellent disease package
- FloRun 157 - Drought tolerant

### Spanish Types (Small pods, early maturity)
- Pronto - 120-day maturity
- OLin - High oleic
- Georgia Red - Traditional variety

Choose variety based on:
- Growing season length (days to maturity)
- Disease pressure in your area
- Market preference (boiling vs. roasting)
- Oil profile (high oleic for longer shelf life)
