# {{NAVIGATOR_NAME}}

{{NAVIGATOR_DESCRIPTION}}

## Setup

This navigator was created using `@platform-ai/autonav`.

### Directory Structure

```
{{NAVIGATOR_NAME}}/
├── config.json          # Navigator configuration
├── CLAUDE.md           # System prompt and grounding rules
├── knowledge-base/     # Add your documentation here
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Adding Documentation

1. Add your markdown files, text files, or documentation to the `knowledge-base/` directory
2. Organize files in subdirectories as needed
3. The navigator will search all files in this directory when answering questions

Example structure:
```
knowledge-base/
├── getting-started/
│   └── quickstart.md
├── deployment/
│   ├── aws.md
│   └── kubernetes.md
└── troubleshooting/
    └── common-issues.md
```

## Querying the Navigator

Use the `nav-query` command to ask questions:

```bash
npx nav-query . "How do I deploy to production?"
```

Or from the parent directory:
```bash
npx nav-query ./{{NAVIGATOR_NAME}} "Your question here"
```

## Response Format

The navigator returns structured JSON responses:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
  "query": "Your question",
  "answer": "Detailed answer with citations",
  "sources": [
    {
      "filePath": "path/to/source.md",
      "excerpt": "Relevant quote",
      "section": "Section name"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## Customization

### Updating Instructions

Edit `CLAUDE.md` to customize how the navigator behaves:
- Add domain-specific rules
- Include terminology definitions
- Specify answer formatting preferences

### Configuration

Edit `config.json` to:
- Update the navigator name or description
- Change the knowledge base path
- Add metadata fields

## Best Practices

1. **Keep docs updated**: The navigator is only as good as the knowledge base
2. **Organize clearly**: Use directories and clear file names
3. **Version control**: Commit both the navigator and knowledge base to git
4. **Review responses**: Check that citations are accurate and relevant

## Troubleshooting

### Navigator can't find files

- Ensure files are in the `knowledge-base/` directory
- Check that file paths in responses match actual files
- Verify the `knowledgeBasePath` in `config.json` is correct

### Low confidence responses

- Add more detailed documentation
- Ensure docs cover the topic thoroughly
- Check that docs are up to date

### No answers to questions

- Verify the knowledge base contains relevant information
- Try rephrasing the question
- Check that Claude API key is set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
