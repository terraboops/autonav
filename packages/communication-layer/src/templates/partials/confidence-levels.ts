export const CONFIDENCE_LEVELS = `### Confidence Assessment

When uncertain about an answer:
- **High confidence**: Information is explicit and well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: Information requires some interpretation or combining sources
- **Low confidence**: Information is sparse, unclear, or partially missing

If your confidence is low, acknowledge the uncertainty and suggest that verification may be needed.`;
